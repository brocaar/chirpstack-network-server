# Contributing

There are a couple of ways to get involved:

* Join the discussions:
    * ChirpStack community forum [https://forum.chirpstack.io/](https://forum.chirpstack.io/)
* Report bugs or make feature-requests by opening an issue at [https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-network-server/issues](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-network-server/issues)
* Help fixing issues or improve documentation by creating pull-requests

When you would like to add new features, please discuss the feature first
by creating an issue describing your feature, how you're planning to implement
it, what the usecase is etc...
