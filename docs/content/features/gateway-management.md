## Gateway management

LoRa Server has support for managing gateways. Gateways can be created either
by enabling *create on stats* (see [gateway configuration]({{<ref "install/config.md">}}))
or by using the [api]({{<ref "integrate/api.md">}}).

### Gateway location

The (last known) location of the gateway will be stored in the database. When
the gateway is equipped with a GPS, its location will be automatically updated
after every stats update. Else, it can be manually set when creating or
updating the gateway.

### Gateway statistics

LoRa Server exposes the gateway statistics on a pre-configured aggregation
intervals (see [gateway configuration]({{<ref "install/config.md">}})).
By default these intervals are configured to: minute, hour and day.

Note that LoRa Server does not implement any retention of the gateway stats.
In case you would like to keep

* the minute interval for one day
* the hour interval for one week
* the day interval for one year

you could use the following queries (e.g. as a cron):

```sql
delete from gateway_stats where "interval" = 'MINUTE' and "timestamp" < now() - interval '1 day';
delete from gateway_stats where "interval" = 'HOUR' and "timestamp" < now() - interval '1 week';
delete from gateway_stats where "interval" = 'DAY' and "timestamp" < now() - interval '1 year';
```

### Gateway JWT token

By using the [api]({{<ref "integrate/api.md">}}), it is possible to generate
a JWT token. This token is used by the [LoRa Channel Manager](https://docs.loraserver.io/lora-channel-manager/)
component.
