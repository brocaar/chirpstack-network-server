# Configuration

To list all configuration options, start `loraserver` with the `--help`
flag. This will display:

The `loraserver` binary has the following command-line flags:

```text
LoRa Server is an open-source network-server, part of the LoRa Server project
        > documentation & support: https://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/
        > source & copyright information: https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver/

Usage:
  loraserver [flags]
  loraserver [command]

Available Commands:
  configfile  Print the LoRa Server configuration file
  help        Help about any command
  version     Print the LoRa Server version

Flags:
  -c, --config string   path to configuration file (optional)
  -h, --help            help for loraserver
      --log-level int   debug=5, info=4, error=2, fatal=1, panic=0 (default 4)

Use "loraserver [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Configuration file

By default `loraserver` will look in the following order for a
configuration file at the following paths when `--config` is not:

* `loraserver.toml` (current working directory)
* `$HOME/.config/loraserver/loraserver.toml`
* `/etc/loraserver/loraserver.toml`

To load configuration from a different location, use the `--config` flag.

To generate a new configuration file `loraserver.toml`, execute the following command:

```bash
loraserver configfile > loraserver.toml
```

Note that this configuration file will be pre-filled with the current configuration
(either loaded from the paths mentioned above, or by using the `--config` flag).
This makes it possible when new fields get added to upgrade your configuration file
while preserving your old configuration. Example:

```bash
loraserver configfile --config loraserver-old.toml > loraserver-new.toml
```

Example configuration file:

```toml

# Log level
#
# debug=5, info=4, warning=3, error=2, fatal=1, panic=0
log_level=4


# PostgreSQL settings.
#
# Please note that PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required.
[postgresql]
# PostgreSQL dsn (e.g.: postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable).
#
# Besides using an URL (e.g. 'postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable')
# it is also possible to use the following format:
# 'user=loraserver dbname=loraserver sslmode=disable'.
#
# The following connection parameters are supported:
#
# * dbname - The name of the database to connect to
# * user - The user to sign in as
# * password - The user's password
# * host - The host to connect to. Values that start with / are for unix domain sockets. (default is localhost)
# * port - The port to bind to. (default is 5432)
# * sslmode - Whether or not to use SSL (default is require, this is not the default for libpq)
# * fallback_application_name - An application_name to fall back to if one isn't provided.
# * connect_timeout - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not specified means wait indefinitely.
# * sslcert - Cert file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
# * sslkey - Key file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
# * sslrootcert - The location of the root certificate file. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
#
# Valid values for sslmode are:
#
# * disable - No SSL
# * require - Always SSL (skip verification)
# * verify-ca - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA)
# * verify-full - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name matches the one in the certificate)

# Automatically apply database migrations.
#
# It is possible to apply the database-migrations by hand
# (see https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver/tree/master/migrations)

# Get downlink data delay.
#
# This is the time that LoRa Server waits between forwarding data to the
# application-server and reading data from the queue. A higher value
# means that the application-server has more time to schedule a downlink
# queue item which can be processed within the same uplink / downlink
# transaction.
# Please note that this value has influence on the uplink / downlink

## Securing the network-server API

In order to protect the network-server API (`network_server.api`) against
unauthorized access and to encrypt all communication, it is advised to use
TLS certificates. Once the `ca_cert`, `tls_cert` and `tls_key` are set,
the API will enforce client certificate validation on all incoming connections.
This means that when configuring this network-server instance in LoRa App Server,
you must provide the CA and TLS client certificate. See also LoRa App Server
[network-server management](https://docs.loraserver.io/lora-app-server/use/network-servers/).

See [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates)
for a set of scripts to generate such certificates.

## Join-server API configuration

In the current implementation LoRa Server uses a fixed join-server URL
(provided by LoRa App Server) which is used as a join-server backend (`join_server.default`).

In case this endpoint is secured using a TLS certificate and expects a client
certificate, you must set `ca_cert`, `tls_cert` and `tls_key`.
Also dont forget to change `server` from `http://...` to `https://...`.

See [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates)
for a set of scripts to generate such certificates.
