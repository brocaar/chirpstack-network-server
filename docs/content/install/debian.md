## Debian / Ubuntu installation

These steps have been tested using:

* Debian Jessie
* Ubuntu Trusty (14.04)
* Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)

### Creating an user and database

LoRa Server needs its **own** database. To create a new database,
start the PostgreSQL prompt as the `postgres` user:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Within the the PostgreSQL prompt, enter the following queries:

```sql
-- create the loraserver_ns user with password 'dbpassword'
create role loraserver_ns with login password 'dbpassword';

-- create the loraserver_ns database
create database loraserver_ns with owner loraserver_as;

-- exit the prompt
\q
```

To verify if the user and database have been setup correctly, try to connect
to it:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U loraserver_ns -W loraserver_ns
```


### LoRa Server Debian repository

The LoRa Server project provides pre-compiled binaries packaged as Debian (.deb)
packages. In order to activate this repository, execute the following
commands:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1CE2AFD36DBCCA00

export DISTRIB_ID=`lsb_release -si`
export DISTRIB_CODENAME=`lsb_release -sc`
sudo echo "deb https://repos.loraserver.io/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} testing" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/loraserver.list
sudo apt-get update
```

### Install LoRa Server

In order to install LoRa Server, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install loraserver
```

After installation, modify the configuration file which is located at
`/etc/default/loraserver`.

Settings you probably want to set / change:

* `POSTGRES_DSN`
* `BAND`
* `NET_ID`
* `DB_AUTOMIGRATE`
* `TIMEZONE`

### Starting LoRa Server

How you need to (re)start and stop LoRa Server depends on if your
distribution uses init.d or systemd.

#### init.d

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/loraserver [start|stop|restart|status]
```

#### systemd

```bash
sudo systemctl [start|stop|restart|status] loraserver
```

### LoRa Server log output

Now you've setup LoRa Server, it is a good time to verify that LoRa Server
is actually up-and-running. This can be done by looking at the LoRa Server
log output.

Like the previous step, which command you need to use for viewing the
log output depends on if your distribution uses init.d or systemd.

#### init.d

All logs are written to `/var/log/loraserver/loraserver.log`.
To view and follow this logfile:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/loraserver/loraserver.log
```

#### systemd

```bash
journalctl -u loraserver -f -n 50
```


Example output:

```
INFO[0000] starting LoRa Server                          band=EU_863_870 docs=https://docs.loraserver.io/ net_id=010203 version=0.12.0
INFO[0000] setup redis connection pool                   url=redis://localhost:6379

```

When you get the following log-messages, it means that LoRa Server can't
connect to the application-server.

```
INFO[0000] grpc: addrConn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = "transport: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8001: getsockopt: connection refused"; Reconnecting to {"127.0.0.1:8001" <nil>}

```

### Configuration

In the example above, we've just touched a few configuration variables.
Run `loraserver --help` for an overview of all available variables. Note
that configuration variables can be passed as cli arguments and / or environment
variables (which we did in the above example).

See [Configuration]({{< relref "config.md" >}}) for details on each config option.

### Install other components

A complete LoRa Server setup, requires the setup of the following components:


* LoRa Server
* [LoRa Gateway Bridge](/lora-gateway-bridge/)
* [LoRa App Server](/lora-app-server/)
