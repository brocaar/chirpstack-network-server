LoRa Server is an open-source LoRaWAN network-server. It is responsible for
handling (and de-duplication) of uplink data received by the gateway(s)
and the scheduling of downlink data transmissions.

## Project components

This project exists out of multiple components

![architecture](https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/image/11010339/L.png)

* [lora-gateway-bridge](https://docs.loraserver.io/brocaar/lora-gateway-bridge) - converts
  the [packet_forwarder protocol](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder/blob/master/PROTOCOL.TXT)
  to MQTT and back
* [loraserver](https://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/) - LoRaWAN network-server
* [lora-app-server](https://docs.loraserver.io/lora-app-server/) - LoRaWAN
  application-server
* lora-controller (todo) - LoRaWAN network-controller

## Documentation

Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/) for the
[getting started](https://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/getting-started/)
documentation and implemented [features](https://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/features/).

## Downloads

Pre-compiled binaries are available for:

* Linux (including ARM / Raspberry Pi)
* OS X
* Windows

See [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver/releases](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver/releases)
for downloads. Source-code can be found at
[https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver).

## Building from source

The easiest way to get started is by using the provided
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environment. To start a bash
shell within the docker-compose environment, execute the following command from
the root of this project:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm loraserver bash
```

A few example commands that you can run:

```bash
# run the tests
make test

# compile
make build

# cross-compile for Linux ARM
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm make build

# cross-compile for Windows AMD64
GOOS=windows BINEXT=.exe GOARCH=amd64 make build

# build the .tar.gz file
make package

# build the .tar.gz file for Linux ARM
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm make build

# build the .tar.gz file for Windows AMD64
GOOS=windows BINEXT=.exe GOARCH=amd64 make build
```

Alternatively, you can run the same commands from any working
[Go](https://golang.org/) environment. As all requirements are vendored,
there is no need to `go get` these, but make sure vendoring is enabled for
your Go environment or that you have Go 1.6+ installed.

## Run VirtualBox machine with Vagrant

Another option for the quick start is script in vagrant subdirectory.
You got Ubuntu based virtual machine with Docker containers and all loraserver components built from source.
